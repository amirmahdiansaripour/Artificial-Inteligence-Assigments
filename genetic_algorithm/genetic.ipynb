      "Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsacker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Important points:\n",
    "1)Since most stages of algorithm are done completely random, these  answers are generally true and you may test a GA with a random population that doesn't accept the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)In each step, next population is made up of a percentage of best-fitting chromosomes in addition to their random offsprings (mostly crossovered and some mutated). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Name some problems of starting a genetic algorithm with an under-crowded population, what about an over-crowded one?\n",
    "Over-Crowded: Although the chance of reaching the goal chromosome is higher in this case, but we should consider the time spent for calculating the fitness of all chromosomes and generating their offsprings when they are alot.\n",
    "Besides, when the number of chromosomes is extremely high, the algorithm may not converge early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under-Crowded: When the first population size is extremely low, we should'nt expect that the final chromosome will appear in our population very soon, due to the limited states of \n",
    "combining the parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the process of making a new generation may not take alot of time, but it should be repeated more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, when the size of a low-populated sample doesn't change during the algorithm, chance of getting stuck and staying in local optimas gets higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) If the population size increases in each step, how does this increasing impact speed and accuracy of algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the size increases, it means that more best-fitting \n",
    "elements and their offsprings are produced and the probabilty that our desired answer is among them increases. In other words, number of iterations of making new population decreases but processing each population takes more time. So there isn't an exact yes/no answer for speed part and highly depends on the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the accuracy, it increases or remains unchanged. Because more offsprings of well-fitted parents (hopefully, with better fitness points) are added. But if we're stuck in a local optima, probably increasing population won't do anything useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) Why does GA use both crossover and mutation methods? What will happen if we use only one of them?\n",
    "Crossover is for convergence and mutation is for divergence of the population. Both are essential based on the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) If crossover is omitted, the population doesn't converge to a specific well-fitted chromosome and some fixed relatively good chromosomes will always appear in the sample and become useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Mutation helps us to move to a different area of solutions if we're converged to and stuck in a local optima and there isn't hope to get better answers. In other words, it helps to diverge the population from it's current state. So if we put it aside, we will probably waste a lot of time in local optimas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4) Which operation has a more positive influence on accuracy? Which one impacts faster?\n",
    "Both crossover and mutation are useful for getting more closed to the global optima in each stage. But as their definition suggests, convergence to an optima (local or global) is the result of crossover. So it seems to affect accuracy better and faster than mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5) Using mutation and crossover, it's possible that after a few steps, the population is still unchanged. How this problem can be solved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying n-point crossover with a high n parameter, and increasing the mutation and crossover probabilities are helpful to change the chromosomes (Note that if mutation probability gets one, chromosomes and respectively the population will difinitely change)\n",
    "\n",
    "    6) If using only one of the methods was allowed, which one would be more helpful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without crossover, the population doesn't converge to a soultion gradually and acts haphazardly. So that the algorithm converts into randomized local search. So it's more necessary than mutation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    7) What techniques can be used in this problem to reach the desired result faster?\n",
    "When calculating fitness, binary search can be used for finding the decoded tokens in the dictionary(sorting the dictionary is done as a preprocess before decoding)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some kinds of parallelism can also be used when tokenizing the dictionary or the encoded text or finding fitnesses\n"
