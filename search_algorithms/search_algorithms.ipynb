    "This assignment is about usage of informed and uninformed search algorthims in finding solutions for \"Gandalf and Gray allies\" game.\n",
    "\n",
    "##   Descriptioin:\n",
    "\n",
    "The game has some actors with different duties:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gandalf: \n",
    "\n",
    "The main character that has to guide the Gray Allies to their safe castles and finally go to the last destination.\n",
    "At each step, Gandalf can carry at most one ally.\n",
    "He is not allowed to go to Orcs' houses, but can move in their under-controlled houses with alot of caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orc(s): \n",
    "\n",
    "They're the strong enemies of Gandalf. Each Orc has a military degree n showing that cells which their Manhattan Distance is less than or equal to n are under conrtol of that Orc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Orc is asleep initially and wakes up only if Gandalf or his friends walk through his under-controlled houses more than n times in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gray Allies: \n",
    "Gandalf friends that need his help to go to their safe castles.\n"

    "## Importing Data and Modeling the game\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, a text file is given as input that contains some data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Rows and columns of the table\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Gondalf initial and destination cell\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Number of Orcs and allies\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Each Orc's position and military degree\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Each ally's initial position\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Each ally's destination(in the same order as number 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling the table (Basic class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is extracted and stored in a class named Basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic class contains some common and basic functions needed for all algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class then makes the match table in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Orcs are displayed with '@'. Each Orc has an index (beginning with A) that under-controlled houses of each is filled with that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Allies are shown with numbers (beginning with 0) and each ally's destination is shown as '&' + ally's number\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another field named 'enemy_strength', which is a dictionary that shows each Orc's military degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling each state\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state in the game (including start and goal states) is a tuple and has some features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Position: (x, y).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Enemy_area: -(no enemy in this cell),A,B,etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Allowed_movements: If Gondalf is currently in an Orc's controlled house, \n",
    "this feature shows how many steps he can take more in this region and the Orc won't wake up. \n",
    "If he isn't in such houses, this value is inf.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Taken_ally: If Gondalf has already taken an ally, this field equals the ally's number; Otherwise, it's -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.Allies_state: A string showing how many and which allies have been currently placed in their castles. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Start and Goal States\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the previous step, features of start and goal states are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Position: Given in the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enemy Area: For both is '-', regarding to the fact that the initial and goal houses aren't under control of any Orc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed_movements: For both is inf, exactly because of the Enemy Area reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken_ally: Obviously its '-1' for start state, and since all alies should be in their destinations by the end, it's '-1' for goal state too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allies_state: It's '0' * number of allies for start, since no ally has reached its destination yet. For goal state this feature is '1' * number of allies.\n"

    "In IDS algorithm, we use the DFS but with a depth limitation (the 'max_depth' field in IDS class). We iteratively increment the depth (run_IDS function for loop); If the goal is met, we're done. Other wise, we keep incrementing the depth ('deepen' function).\n",

    "In deepen function, we do the same process of run_BFS except that we use recursion to explore new nodes (DFS approach). \n",

    "What's more, in this algorithm, we should keep the distance (or cost) of each node from root and update it if we met a duplicated node with lower cost (second 'if' in action_IDS). The reason is obvious since we said that exploring nodes is depth-wise.  "
